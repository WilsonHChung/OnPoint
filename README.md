# OnPoint

OnPoint is an iOS game application where three randomized numbers are shown to a player each round. The player has to attempt to align each slider to approximately where he or she believes the number is located on the slider. If the player is exactly on point, 100 points are awarded and the round continues. If the player is 2 numbers off of the actual location of the randomized number, 10 points are awarded and the round continues. However, if the player is off by more than 2 for any of the sliders, the game restarts to the beginning. The objective is to get as many rounds and scoring opportunities as possible. Good luck!
